## 1. Project Goal

This project is a complete case study in bioinformatics biomarker discovery, from hypothesis to a definitive, publication-ready conclusion.

**The Goal:** To test the "metabolic conflict" hypothesis in melanoma, investigating if a signature based on glutamine and IFNγ gene expression could predict patient survival or response to immunotherapy.

**The Approach:** The analysis was conducted end-to-end in R, involving data acquisition and processing, advanced statistical modeling, and publication-quality data visualization.

## 2. Data Sourcing and Processing

To ensure a rigorous analysis, two independent patient cohorts were used:

*   **Discovery Cohort (TCGA):** RNA-Seq (TPM) and clinical data for **469** skin cutaneous melanoma (TCGA-SKCM) patients were acquired from the GDC Data Portal using the R/Bioconductor package `TCGAbiolinks`. This cohort was used to assess the signature's prognostic value.

*   **Validation Cohort (GEO):** Pre-treatment RNA-Seq (FPKM) and clinical response data for **49** metastatic melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO accession: GSE91061). This cohort was used to validate the signature's predictive value.

The R scripts in the `/R_scripts` folder document the entire process, including data cleaning, normalization, and the GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis) used to calculate the signature scores.

## 3. The Final Conclusion

The signature failed to provide independent prognostic or predictive value. While a promising trend was observed in the discovery cohort, the biomarker was not statistically significant after adjusting for clinical variables and failed validation in an independent immunotherapy cohort.

This repository showcases the key outputs and the R code used to generate them.

## 4. Key Outputs

### Figure 1: Prognostic Value in TCGA Cohort (n=313)

The "Favorable" group (Low Gln/High IFNg) showed a non-significant trend towards improved survival.
*(log-rank p = 0.081)*

### Figure 2: Predictive Value in GEO Cohort (n=49)

The signature showed no ability to predict response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.
*(Chi-squared p = 0.706)*

### Table 1: Final Multivariable Survival Model (TCGA)

After adjusting for clinical factors like age and tumor stage, neither the glutamine score, the IFNγ score, nor their interaction were significant independent predictors of survival.

| Predictor                  | Hazard Ratio (HR) | P-value |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Glutamine Score            | 0.576             | 0.460   |
| IFNγ Response Score        | 0.368             | 0.095   |
| **Age (per year)**         | **1.030**         | **0.019**   |
| Gender (Male vs. Female)   | 0.887             | 0.707   |
| Tumor Stage (Late vs. Early) | 1.038             | 0.904   |
| Interaction Term           | 0.326             | 0.378   |
